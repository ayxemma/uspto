Application XML1
================

Things I have already checked and validated
1. AGENT_A : Address, LastName, FirstName, Country Are NOT included in raw data
2. ASSIGNEE_A : Most City, State, Country are not available from raw data
3. INVENTOR_A : No nationality or residence is included in raw data
4. APPLICANT_A : No applicant data is available for XML1

** Maybe INVENTOR_A nationality and residence can be removed as table fields

Application XML4
================

1. AGENT_A : NO agent data is available in XML4 application raw data
2. ASSIGNEE_A : Address is not available in XML4 application
3. ASSIGNEE_A, sometimes there is no orgname, there is only firstname / lastname
4. USCLASS_A : *** there are VERY FEW usclass available in some XML4 application raw data
5. USCLASS_A : *** There is not discernable way to interpret the US class in 2010 files.
  There are leading spaces, sometimes no spaces, sometimes dividing spaces.  No documentation.

NOTE: possible to get the application USCLASS from the office action API?

Grant APS
=========

1. FOREIGNPRIORITY_G : There is no `kind` available (can be removed from table?)
2. FORPATCIT_G : There is no `kind` `category`, or `name` available in raw data
3. GRACIT_G : No `kind`, category, available in raw data
4. GRANT : app_type is single digit ID, not sure the meaning
5. APPLICANT_G : There is no applicant data available in raw data

Grant XML2
==========

1. FOREIGNPRIORITY_G : There is no `kind` available (can be removed from table?)
2. Grant length is available in some grant XML but it's 0 in database instead of NULL when not available
4. INVENTOR_G : Nationality and Residence are available but not being parsed
5. GRACIT_G : tag combines US and non-us patcit.  How to tell the difference?  Some don't have `kind`, none have a country.
  the manual says that US citations are first.  The ones without a `kind` are always last... but some without `kind`
  also seem to have a US patent number?
6. APPLICANT_G : XML2 grants do not have any applicant data available
7. ASSIGNEE_G: First and Last Name maybe available in the XML2 data but Its not being parsed.  Only orgname is.
  The reason is because First and Last Name are not available in the grant XML4 data.
8. FORPATCIT_G : I don't know if the method for parsing out is OK or not.  The verification script does not deal with FORPATCIT_G for grant XML2.

Grant XML4
==========

1. Grant length is available sometimes, but it's 0 in the database instead of null?
2. AGENT_G if no country provided then unknown is provided
3. GRACIT_G many citation records do not have name.
4. Not handling the <additional-info> element, is optional and can occur one time identifying an unstructured US classification referenced within the <us-field-of-classification-search> element, and terminated by the </additional-info> end tag.
An unstructured US classification would identify a sub-class as a range as defined in the example below:
<main-classification> 2247-250</main-classification> <additional-info>unstructured</additional-info>
